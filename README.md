### 5. Review & Quiz System ✅

To ensure solid memorization, the app features an integrated multiple-choice quiz system:

* **"Practicing" Button 🎯:** Click to perform a quick exercise (Fill-in-the-blanks & Translation) for that specific verse to reinforce your memory.

* **Custom Review & Practice:** You can select specific cells on the progress grid (by **long-pressing** them). The system will then generate a custom quiz consisting only of the lines you selected for review.
* **Achievements:** You will receive a **"Sikkhāpadavidū"** banner for completing a sutta, and a **"Vinayavidū"** Medal Modal for completing the entire text.
